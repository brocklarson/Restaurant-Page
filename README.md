This restaurant page project was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The restaurant page is for Tandoori Oven, which is a real restaurant and one of my favorites. All information, logos, and images are owned by Tandoori Oven. This page was built only for the purpose of practicing node and webpack principles taught in The Odin Project curriculum.
